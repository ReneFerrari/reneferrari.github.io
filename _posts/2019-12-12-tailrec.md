## Introduction
`tailrec` is a keyword which enables optimization of tail recursive functions. These are functions that have a recursive call as their last statement. Instead of creating a new stack entry for each recursive call, functions marked as tailrec "reuse" the existing one. 

 A simple example:

{% highlight kotlin %}
tailrec fun factorial(start: Int, accumulator: Int = 1): Int = when (start) {
    1 -> accumulator
    else -> factorial(start - 1, accumulator * start)
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Comparison to a regular recursive function
The previously shown function could be written without tailrec - like this:

{% highlight kotlin %}
fun factorialRegular(start: Int, accumulator: Int = 1): Int = when (start) {
    1 -> accumulator
    else -> factorialRegular(start - 1, accumulator * start)
}
{% endhighlight %}

To understand how the tailrec version is "reusing" the stack entry we must take a look at the bytecode decompiled to Java:

{% highlight kotlin %}
// tailrec version
public static final int factorial(int start, int accumulator) {
    while(true) {
        switch(start) {
        case 1:
        return accumulator;
        default:
        int var10000 = start - 1;
        accumulator *= start;
        start = var10000;
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight kotlin %}
// regular version
public static final int factorialRegular(int start, int accumulator) {
    int var10000;
    switch(start) {
    case 1:
        var10000 = accumulator;
        break;
    default:
        var10000 = factorialRegular(start - 1, accumulator * start);
    }

    return var10000;
}
{% endhighlight %}

You will immediately notice that a function marked as tailrec is actually not recursive (on a decompiled Java code level).
Instead the whole magic behind it is just an endless while loop.
