## Basics
In simple terms, a range consists of all the numbers which exist in a certain ordered closed interval (inclusively defined by a lower and an upper bound value).
They are a very nice feature of the language and efficent in its use. If you are unfamiliar with ranges but already have a foundational knowledge of Kotlin you 
may have already encountered them:

{% highlight kotlin %}
for (i in 1..10) {
    println(i)
}
{% endhighlight %}

Behind `1..10` lies an `IntRange` which is created from the invocation of `rangeTo()` (you can check this by going to the definition of the dots between 1 and 10).
As I have mentioned previously ranges are inclusive therefore the for loop is equivalent to: `i >= 1 && i <= 10`.

If you need to iterate reversed (greater lower bound than upper bound) you can't use the `..` but instead have to rely on `downTo`:

{% highlight kotlin %}
for (i in 10 downTo 1) {
    println(i)
}
{% endhighlight %}

This for loop is equivalent to `i <= 10 && i >= 1`.

Another feature of ranges is defining a custom `step` (it is 1 by default).

{% highlight kotlin %}
for (i in 2..10 step 2) {
    println(i)
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now this will only print equal numbers from 2 to 10 inclusively.

Sometimes you may need to exclude the upper bound of the range when it is defined by the size of a list. Instead of writing `0..(list.size - 1)`
you can write `0 until list.size` which looks way cleaner. Lastly, if you want to check if a certain value is inside a range you can do that with
the `in` operator like `5 in 1..10`.

## Further functionality
In the previous chapter I have already covered some functionality of ranges but not all of it. When taking a look at the [content of kotlin.ranges](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.ranges/index.html)
you can see it also contains the following functions (not mentioned yet):
{% highlight kotlin %}
val someNumber = 67
val foo = 50

println(foo.coerceAtLeast(someNumber))
println(foo.coerceAtMost(someNumber))
println(foo.coerceIn(0..someNumber))
{% endhighlight %}

This will print `67 50 50`. Explanation:
- `coerceAtLeast` will return at least the value of the passed argument. Since 67 is greater than 50 67 is returned
- `coerceAtMost` will return at most the value of the passed argument. In our case 67 is less than 50 so 50 is returned
- `coerceIn` will return a value inside the range passed as argument of the function. In our case the foo is inside the range so the value of foo (50) is returned.
If foo was -1, 0 (the lower bound of the range) would be returned - similarily if foo was 68, 67 (the upper bound) would be returned.


{% highlight kotlin %}
print((0..100).random())
{% endhighlight %}

Random - you guessed it - simply creates a random value from a given range. 

{% highlight kotlin %}
for (i in (1..10).reversed()) {
    println(i)
}
{% endhighlight %}

Basically the same as `10 downTo 1` (using `downTo` is preferred).

{% highlight kotlin %}
println((0..10).contains(5))
{% endhighlight %}

Same as `5 in 0..10` (using `in` is preferred).

## Closing words
Keep in mind that only ranges based on `Int` or `Char` can be "converted" to a list using the `toList()` function.
Furthermore you can create a range with letters (like `'a'..'z'`) when checking if a character is inside a certain range.

Ranges can be very useful if used correctly and are one of many great features in Kotlin.
